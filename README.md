## Usage

### Server
1. Start the server:
```bash
./mainserver
```

2. Use the interactive menu to:
- List active backdoors
- Send commands
- Load modules
- Update backdoors
- View backdoor information
- Broadcast commands

### Backdoor
1. Configure the backdoor:
- Set WizardServerIP to your server's IP/domain
- Adjust other constants as needed

2. Deploy the backdoor:
```bash
./backdoor
```

The backdoor will:
- Attempt to gain elevated privileges
- Establish persistence
- Connect to the server
- Execute received commands

## Security Considerations

- Generate strong TLS certificates
- Change default SecretKey
- Use proper firewall rules
- Monitor for suspicious connections
- Regularly update exploits
- Use secure deployment methods

## Architecture

### Server Components
- TLS Server
- Connection Handler
- Command Processor
- Update Manager
- Module Loader
- Monitor System

### Backdoor Components
- Connection Manager
- Privilege Handler
- Anti-Analysis System
- Exploit Manager
- Recovery System
- Persistence Manager

## Network Protocol

1. Initial Connection:
   - TLS Handshake
   - Authentication
   - System Information Exchange

2. Command Protocol:
   - Obfuscated Commands
   - Result Reporting
   - Heartbeat System

3. Update Protocol:
   - Version Check
